The class notes are available on this page as they are
developed and refined.
Some may not be available until after
they are discussed in class. Please realize that the notes are continuously
being updated. If you down
load the notes for the next section before we talk about the material,
what is discussed in class may differ. These class notes are automatically
converted from word processing format (FrameMaker) to html.
The conversion is not
always the best, so what you see in html may differ in format from what is
used in class.
