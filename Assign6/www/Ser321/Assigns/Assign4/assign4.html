<p>
The learning outcomes of this assignment are:
<ol>
<li>Ability to apply the distribution middleware framework <b>Java RMI</b>
    to client-server distributed applications.
</li>
<li>Experience in configuring networking and system initialization for
    a Linux-based minimal computer -- Raspberry Pi.
</li>
<li>Knowledge working with the <b>Ant</b> build tool and the command-line for
    developing distributed applications.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Before you start on this assignment, complete
<b>Unit 6: Object-Based Client-Server Communications</b> as described
in the course <a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Ser321/Schedule/schedule.html" target="_blank">
detailed schedule</a>. This exercise is to demonstrate a distributed
<b>Java RMI</b> application in which the server is running on <b>Raspberry Pi</b>,
and the client is running on <b>Virtual Box Debian Jessie Linux</b>.
<p>
In this assignment you are to complete configuration of your <b>Raspberry Pi</b>
computer with the <b>Raspbian</b> Linux system, and establish the ability
to connect to the computer from your Virtual Box Linux system via <b>ssh</b>.
You will demonstrate successful configuration of the system by submitting
LXTerminal screen shots from your Virtual Box Linux system demonstrating
two machine execution of a <b>Java RMI</b> example. The class web site has a
page outlining how to <a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Ser321/Resources/buildRaspberry.html" target="_blank">
Setup Raspberry Pi for Ser321</a>.
<p>
You are to submit this assignment as two LXTerminal screen shots. One for
the server and the other for the client. Below is a description of each
screen shot.
<ul>
  <li><b>Server</b>. Use the class example
  <b>employee.jar</b> and copy it to the <b>Raspberry Pi</b>.
  Use <b>ssh</b> to log onto the
  <b>Raspberry Pi</b>. Extract the example jar file and change to the <b>Employee</b>
  directory. Use the appropriate <b>Ant</b> command to start the server, be sure
  to include in the <b>Ant</b> command line the definition of the <b>Raspberry Pi</b>
  host name or IP and a port number to use for the <b>RMI Registry</b>. After the
  server starts and registers itself with the registry return to the clients LXTerminal.
  </li><br>
  <li><b>Client</b>. On Virtual Box Linux, change to the folder containing the
  <b>employee.jar</b> archive. Extract the archive using <b>jar</b>.
  Change to the <b>Employee</b> folder.
  Enter the appropriate <b>Ant</b> command to cause the client to build and execute.
  Be sure to include command line definitions of the <b>hostId</b> and <b>regPort</b>
  properties. The hostId should be the IP of the <b>Raspberry Pi</b> (same as used
  for the server), and the port should also match the value used on the server
  machine.</li><br>
</ul>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What To Hand-In</FONT></B>
<p>

Submit your solution as a Java archive file (jar) of the project directory
<b>Assign4</b>. Place only the two screen shot files in the <b>Assign4</b> folder.
Grading your project will be done by extracting the jar and examining
the screen shots.
Hand-in this program using the submission link for this assignment on the course Blackboard site.
<p>
When extracted, your solution jar file should create the directory
<b>Assign4</b>
with only your solution files as specified above. Create your jar file from
a command line whose current working directory is <b>Assign4</b>'s
parent directory. Execute the command:
<br><center><font color=#9B0033>
jar -cvf assign4myname.jar Assign4/
</font></center><br>
The instructors solution would be created and named as:
<br><center><font color=#9B0033>
jar -cvf assign4TimLindquist.jar Assign4/
</font></center><br>
Before you submit the jar file, please do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Check to assure your solution conforms to the directions on this page.</li><br>
  <li>Consider the grading criteria as shown below to be sure that you'll
  receive full credit for your submission.
  Of 20 possible points, they are awarded for:
  <ol> 
    <li>Server screen shot follows the directions specified above and the
    employee RMI server runs properly on your Raspberry Pi (10 points).</li><br>
    <li>Client screen shot follows the directions specified above and the
    employee RMI client runs properly on your Virtual Box Linux system (10 points).
    </li><br>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Clean your solution directory of any temporary files
      before creating the jar file. Extract the solution
      in another directory, build and execute the solution to be certain
      it works properly.
</ul>
