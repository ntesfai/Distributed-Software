<li><b>Computing Environment</b>. You will be developing software to run on two machines
    (computing environments) for the class. The development enviroment will be used for
code development, and running clients. The development environment should be
Debian Stretch (9.x) Linux running under Virtual Box on your laptop or desktop computer.
The deployment machine will be Raspberry Pi also running Debian Stretch (9.x) Linux, and it
    will not be used for code development, but will be used to run servers.
    Some servers you'll be running on the Raspberry Pi are examples made available
by the instructor, others, you will develop.
To support course outcomes, the development and deployment
    environments are Linux, and they should be configured so they can reach other via
    the internet.
    Usually the easiest is to physically connect them with an ethernet cable.
    You may also connect them wirelessly using a router,
    Using wireless will make it difficult to
    use the Raspberry Pi in the classroom. All of the projects in
    this course are submitted in a format that is buildable on these
    environments. The examples we will be using are developed to
    run (only) on these environments, and all classroom discussions will focus only on
    these environments.
    <br><br>
    <ul>
       <li><u><b>Development Environment</b>.</u>  If you don't have a machine
      that boots into a Debian Stretch (9.x) Linux system, you will need to download,
      install and configure a Debian Stretch (9.x) Linux system as a guest system on
      <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a>.
      We will be installing <b>Java SE JDK 9, Ant,</b> and <b>GNU C++</b>
      with some additional libraries for language. Here are
      <a href="./buildVB.html" target="_blank">instructions for setting
      up Virtual Box</a> and its guest Linux machine. You will be required to hand in programs
      that you develop in a format similar to that used for open source software packages.
      The course does not specify or utilize an integraded development environment, and the
      format you must submit does not lend itself to using an IDE.
      <br><br>
      <li><u><b>Deployment Environment</b>.</u> Each student should
      purchase and configure a <b>Raspberry Pi</b>. When you search, you'll find there
      are 3 different models available. The least capable onto which you can load Raspbian
      will work fine for the course. You should consider purchasing the most recent version since it may
      be useful in subsequent courses. Don't plan to do development on the Raspberry
          Pi. It is not capable enough to be a good development platform,
          but it will work fine for building and running the server components.
          Here's a typical parts list for the Raspberry Pi.<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Raspberry Pi</b>. The Raspberry Pi is
            an inexpensive system on a chip computer. See the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank">
            Raspberry Pi Wikipedia</a> page. <b>RPi 3 model B</b> has
            1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM processor with 1GB of onboard
            RAM, but does not have a disk. Instead, it uses an SD
            card (micro SD, depending on model).
            The Raspberry Pi 3 B is available from Amazon with a case and wireless
            adapter for about $50. You will also need the parts,
            below, whether you buy them as a package, or otherwise have them.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>SB Raspberry Pi Case</b>.
            Available for under $10.00.
            The case is optional, but recommended.</li><br>
            <li><b>C&E USB to MicroUSB cable</b>. Available from several sources
            for a couple dollars. You may have one, as they are commonly
            used for cameras and other digital devices.</li><br>
            <li><b>5V 1A USB Port Power Supply</b>. This is available from
            $3 to $10. This
            is to plug the cable above into 110V AC wall outlet. On OSX,
            if you have a laptop with USB version 3, then its USB ports provide
            5V at 900mA. The Raspberry Pi Model B specs call for 700 mA. I've
            powered my Raspberry Pi with a Mac USB2, which provides 5V 500mA,
            with no problem, but I wouldn't connect any USB devices to the Pi's
            USB ports and expect them to also be powered by a laptop's USB port.
            If you have a laptop with USB3 then it
            should (you should check the specifications of the laptop to be
            sure) provide sufficient power for the Raspberry Pi.</li><br>
            <li><b>3 ft of RJ45 Cat5e cable</b>. To bring the RPi to class,
            please do NOT plan to connect it using ASU wireless.
            Instead plan for a direct connect to your laptop. Plan to use
            a short ethernet cable to connect your laptop to the Raspberry Pi.
            Although ASU IT doesn't support it, your
            laptop can provide internet access for the Raspberry Pi through the laptop's
            wireless connection.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>SD Card</b>. You won't need more than 12GB for this
            class and the faster the better. The Raspberry Pi boots from
            the SD card and uses it as the disk for its file system.
            Don't get an SD card that's pre-loaded with the Raspberry Pi
            operating system. They don't come with the OS that we'll be using:
            Raspberry Pi's Debian Stretch (9.x). Setup is straightforward.</li><br>
         </ul>
         Incase you are hesitant to buy a Raspberry Pi, you'll likely find
         other uses for it besides this course. We won't be using any of the
         IO capabilities of the device, but if you take either the sensors and
         actuators course or the embedded C class, you'll likely make use of
         your Raspberry Pi. You can also configure it with your TV for video
         and audio playback, for emulating video games, as well as other useful
         server tasks.</li><br>
      </ul>
</li><br>
<li><b>Building the software system on your Raspberry Pi.</b> Our goal is to
configure a Debian Stretch (9.x) Linux on the Raspberry Pi (often referred to as
Raspbian) with a user account for you. Here are <a href="./buildRaspberry.html" target="_blank">
references and directions</a> for setting up your Raspberry Pi.
And, here is another
<a href="http://www.toptal.com/raspberry-pi/how-to-turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-a-development-server">quick setup guide</a>.
 <ul>
  <li>While there are other options for the system running on Raspberry Pi, we
      will be using <b>Debian Stretch (9.x)</b> (also called <b>Raspbian</b>) for Ser321. If you'd like to know more
      about administering this Linux operating system get the Administrator's
      handbook at
