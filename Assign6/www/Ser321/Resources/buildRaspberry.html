</U></H2>
<p>
The goal is to configure <b>Debian Stretch (9.x)</b> Linux operating system on
the Raspberry Pi (called Raspbian) and intialize its networking through a direct ethernet
connection to your laptop. These steps allow
you to access the Raspberry Pi without a keyboard or display attached to
the Raspberry Pi. Infact without anything attached except for the SD card,
ethernet cable, and power cable. We'll access it by <b>ssh</b> from
a command prompt running on your development machine. Here are the steps.
<ul>
   <li>
      <b>The OS Image for Debian Stretch (9.x) (full).</b> Download the <b>RASPBIAN</b> zip
      image file from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/" target="_blank">
      Raspberry Pi Raspbian Downloads</a>. Extract the zip file to get
      the <b>.img</b> file. Make a note of the path to the image file.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Write the OS Image to an SD Card</b>.
      <ul>
         <li><b>Easy Setup</b>. See:
            <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup" target="_blank">
            http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup</a>
            for setup from either <b>Windows</b> or <b>Mac OS X</b>.</li><br>
         <li><b>MacOS</b>. Alternatively, you will also find directions on the
            <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md" target="_blank">
            Raspberry Pi Documentation Page</a>.</li></br>
         <li><b>Windows</b>. Alternatively, follow the directions on the
            <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md" target="_blank">
            Raspberry Pi Documentation Page</a>.</li>
      </ul>
   </li><br>
   <li>If you downloaded and wrote the <b>Rasbian Stretch with desktop</b> version to your <b>SD</b>
   card, and you plan to access it headless (remotely -- you don't plan to hook up a
   keyboard and monitor) then you will need to follow the directions at:
   <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=191252" target="_blank">
   https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=191252</a>.
   Doing so, you will place a file named <b>ssh</b> in the boot <b>SD</b> disk before you
   startup the <b>Raspberry Pi</b>. Such as the following MacOS terminal command immediately
   after writing the image to the <b>SD</b>:
   <b><br>
   cat > /Volumes/boot/ssh<br>
   ^C<br></b></li><br>
   <li><b>Configure the Laptop to Share a Wireless Connection</b>.
   With a direct ethernet connection (cable), the Rasbperry Pi can be configured by
   default to receive an IP address through
   <b>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</b> running on a laptop.
   DHCP is used to
   dynamically distribute network configuration parameters, such as IP
   addresses. With a direct ethernet connection between a laptop and
   Raspberry Pi, you can easily configure the laptop to share its wireless
   connection with your <b>RPi</b>.
   Connect the Raspberry Pi to your laptop by an ethernet cable
   (Cat5e cable), before powering on the Raspberry Pi follow the directions below:
      <ul>
        <li><b>MacOS</b>. On <b>MacOS</b>, open up
        <b>System Preferences --> Sharing</b>. Select the line for
        <b>Internet Sharing</b> and select to share your <b>Wi-Fi</b>
        connection to computers using <b>Ethernet (or Thunderbolt Bridge)</b>.
        Then check the
        <b>Internet Sharing</b> service <b>On</b> box to start the
        service.</li><br>
      </ul><p>
   <li><b>Startup the Raspberry Pi</b>. Insert the SD card into the
      Raspberry Pi. Using a normal ethernet cable, connect the Raspberry
      Pi to a MacOS compututer. Or, if you are using Windows, you may need to
      connect a keyboard and display to the Raspberry Pi to configure its networking
      after it starts up. By direct connect MacOS, you may avoid using a keyboard
      and display by using a terminal (either in the VB Linux or MacOS).
      <br>
      <ul>
      <li>On MacOS, run the <b>Terminal</b> app which you will find under<br><b>
         Applications --> Others or Applications --> Utilites
      </b><br>
      Run the <b>Terminal</b> app. <br>
      <li>In the terminal, enter:<br><b>
      ssh  pi@192.168.2.2</b></br>
        The password is: <b>raspberry</b>. <br><b>Note</b>: You may need to try
        different ip's.
        On MacOS, you can find what IPs your <b>dhcp</b> server has allocated with the
        following command:<br>
        <b>sudo cat /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases</b><br>
        If you're not successful finding the correct IP,
        connect a monitor and keyboard to the pi. Power up again, and
        configure it from the desktop. You can find its ip(s) from the command line,
        with: <b>ifconfig -a</b><br>
        After successfully logging in, you should change the password for the user
        <b>pi</b> with the command:<br>
        <b>sudo passwd pi</b><br>
        the system will prompt you for the current and new passwords.</li>
      <li>Now add yourself as a user. Be sure
      to substitute your <b>asuriteid</b> everywhere below for
      <b>myasuriteid</b>.
      Some homework submissions will require screen shots that show
        RPi terminal sessions for your <b>asuriteid</b>.
        <br>Add a user who's login is <b>myasuriteid</b>. In doing
      so indicate you want your user's directory to be <b>/home/myasuriteid</b>,
      that you want to execute bash when logging in remotely, and that
      your user should be in the <b>pi</b> group. Create the user with:<br><b>
      sudo adduser --home /home/myasuriteid --shell /bin/bash --ingroup pi myasuriteid</b><br>
      For example, you may enter:<br><b>
      sudo adduser --home /home/jimsmith --shell /bin/bash --ingroup pi jimsmith</b><br></li>
      <li>You can (re)set the password for the new user with:<b><br>
      sudo passwd myasuriteid</b><br>
      And, enter the information as requested.<br></li>
      <li>To provide the new user with
      root (sudo) privileges you must: Either execute<br><b>
      sudo adduser myasuriteid sudo<br>
      </b></li>
      <li>Now reboot and log in using your userId. There are few more steps you should complete before
      loading software. First update your system with changes since the
      distribution of the installation CD. To do so, your system needs to be
      connected to the internet, which it probably already is:<br><b>
      sudo apt-get update<br>
      sudo apt-get upgrade<br></b>
      This may take some time, and you will probably need to reboot and
      reconnect (login) after the upgrade completes.
      Now, you should complete the configuration of <b>Raspbian</b>
      by entering:<br><b>
      sudo raspi-config<br></b>
      Select <b>Advanced Options --> Expand Filesystem</b> so the entire <b>SD</b> card will be used. There
      may be other settings you would like to make, such as setting the systems hostname.
      Under <b>Localisation Options</b> remove locale <b>en_GB...</b> by pressing space
      bar, and add <b>en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8</b> again by pressing the space bar then
      tabbing to <b>OK</b>.
      <li>When you are done with a session on the RPi, instead of exiting (<b>exit</b>)
      from the RPi shell, you may want to halt or reboot your system.
      Do so by entering:<br><b>
      sudo shutdown -h now<br></b>
      Which will shutdown the linux system gracefully and automatically log
      you off of the system. You can replace <b>-h</b> (halt) with <b>-r</b> to
      cause your RPi to reboot.</li></ul></li><br>
      <li><b>Configuring Wireless on Raspberry Pi</b>. Instead of (or in addition to)
      a direct ethernet connection to the <b>RPi</b>, a wireless
      connection maybe appropriate. Here
      are two references: Configuring 
      <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md"
      target="_blank">Wifi from the command line</a>, Debian Wiki
      <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse" target="_blank">How to Use WIFI</a>.
      </li><br>
      <li><b>Adding packages to the RPi</b>. If your <b>RPi</b> is able to
      access the internet through wireless or your laptop, then you can use the
      <b>apt-get</b> package manager to install other software.
      You will need the same packages on your Raspberry Pi as on VirtualBox except the
      GUI packages (<b>FLTK</b>).<br>
      See <a href="RaspberryPi/AptPackageManagerCommands.txt" target="_blank">
      AptPackageManagerCommands.txt</a> for a quick overview of package
      management with <b>apt-get</b> and <b>aptitude</b>.</li><br>
      <li><b>Retro-Video Games</b>. There are lots of fun projects for your Pi.
      If you are into video games, you may be interested in installing
      <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/" target="_blank">Retro-Pie</a> on your
      Raspberry Pi. <b>This is NOT required for the course.</b> To do so see:
      <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Manual-Installation/" target="_blank">InstallRetro-Pie On Raspbian</a>.
